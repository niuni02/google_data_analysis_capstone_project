# google_data_analysis_capstone_project
This is the code I wrote in RStudio as part of the Google Analytics Professional Certificate final Capstone Case Study. The scenario asked "How can a wellness company play it smart?". It is the first time I worked with a large dataset on my own, but definitely not the last! I hope to improve my skills in R programming moving forward.
